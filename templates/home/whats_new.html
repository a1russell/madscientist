	<h1>What's New</h1>
	<p>Glad you asked.</p>
	<p>This is the revamped "what's new" for the content of the site. I realized that there was just entirely too much technical stuff to muddle through for someone just wanting to see what the latest additions are. So here you go, a more concise list for your browsing pleasure. Enjoy!</p>
	<p>If you're actually <b>looking</b> for the techie talk, you can find it in the <a href="">site's evolution log</a>.</p>
	<p>Also, remember that the vault has it's own <a href="">What's New</a> page, but as with the rest of the vault, you must be a member to view it.</p>
